                <p>Tsunamis are giant waves caused by earthquakes or volcanic eruptions under the sea.<br> 
                    Out in the depths of the ocean, tsunami waves do not dramatically increase in height. <br>
                    But as the waves travel inland, they build up to higher and higher heights as the depth of the ocean decreases.<br>  
                    The speed of tsunami waves depends on ocean depth rather than the distance from the source of the wave. <br>
                    Tsunami waves may travel as fast as jet planes over deep waters, only slowing down when reaching shallow waters.<br>  
                    While tsunamis are often referred to as tidal waves,
                    this name is discouraged by oceanographers because tides have little to do with these giant waves.

                <p>
                    1. If there's an earthquake while you are on the coast and indoors, drop, cover and hold on. If you're outside, stay away from falling objects.<br> 
                    2. When the shaking is over, move quickly to inland, higher ground. Go on foot if you can. Stay there until officials say it's all clear.<br> 
                    3. Bring your animals if you evacuate. Bring your preparedness kit.<br> 
                    4. Listen to official sources such as a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration weather radio or the U.S.<br>
                    5. Coast Guard emergency frequency station if a tsunami watch has been issued.<br>

                    1. Tell family and friends you're OK.<br>

                    2. Keep tuned in to official information sources or local media.<br>
                
                    3. Don't assume the danger is over after the first wave. The next one might be bigger.<br>
                
                    4. Call authorities if someone needs to be rescued.<br>
                
                    5. Help people such as the elderly, infants and people with disabilities.<br>
                
                    6. Stay away from disaster zones and out of buildings that have water around them.<br>
                
                    7. Be cautious when re-entering buildings and cleaning up.
